It was intended to be only a 2 week endeavor, however with me constantly getting new ideas, it took more than a month. It is made with React and it is my first finished React project, despite the numerous times I have worked with the framework. I have to say that it was a great learning experience. <br /> You can check the libraries I used and the code itself in the Github repository:"
