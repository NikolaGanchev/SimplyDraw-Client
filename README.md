# SimplyDraw

## Intro

SimplyDraw is a website that allows you, as the name suggests, to simply draw. No pop ups. No home pages. No registrations. No downloading apps. No tracking and half-screen-taking cookie notices (because there are no cookies). Just you, a canvas and tools. When you finish, you just download your canvas as a .png. Browser-side until you decide it shouldn't be. Then, you can draw with friends, or just about anyone. When you create a room, you are the host. You can mute members (people that joined the room) or mute everyone by default. You can disband the room or kick people. Everyone else is a member, who can watch and draw, unless you mute them. Then, they can only watch. Simple, right? And if your connection dies mid drawing, the first member to join inherits the room and becomes the host. You can rejoin as a member and continue drawing. Even if you get disconnected, you can just download your work.
